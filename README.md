# NYC-CitiBike

## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the potential viability of a bikeshare program in Des Moines, IA based on data from the bikeshare program in New York City. This was done utilizing data from August, 2019 and visualized using Tableau which can be viewed [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/cody6306/viz/NYCCitiBikeChallenge_16620704698880/Story1?publish=yes)

## Results

After conducting this analysis, we see some common trends. Firstly, the majority of riders are subscribers to the bikeshare service in NYC, as detailed by the graph below. This is key to keep in mind for investors – if you can figure out a way to gain subscriptions, your likelihood of success increases.

Moreover, the majority of subscribers to bikeshare services in NYC are males. Additionally, the majority of riders – sans a peak of those born in the late 60s – were born between 1988 and 1992, indicating an age trend of young professionals preferring to have a bike subscription for their travels around NYC.

Finally, we come to the time-of-day data. As evidence by this heat map, the most popular times of day for bike checkouts are common commuter hours; either before work (7-9 AM Monday through Friday) or after work (5-6 pm Monday through Friday). While this trend is evident, it’s also important to call out a more consistent flow of riders on Saturday through the day, while not having the M-F spike, this still proves to be a worthwhile time to explore for ridership.

## Summary

In summation, the data presented here proves that investing in a bikeshare operation in a major metropolitan area with a high population of young professionals would be beneficial to both the community and the investors alike. While the population of Des Moines is certainly different than that of New York, there are undoubtedly enough similarities in demographic to have success running a similar operation on a smaller scale.
